### Project Description
[Pollution Tracker: Community Reporting System

The Pollution Tracker is a web-based platform designed to help communities report pollution issues in their localities. Users can submit reports detailing environmental concerns such as air, water, and land pollution, which are then directly forwarded via email to local authorities for prompt action.

To ensure accountability, the system monitors the response from local authorities. If no action is taken within a specified timeframe, the report is automatically escalated to higher authorities for further intervention. This approach enhances environmental governance and encourages quick resolutions to pollution problems.

Key Features:

User-Friendly Reporting: Simple form-based submission for pollution incidents.

Email Notifications: Automated emails sent to relevant authorities.

Escalation Mechanism: Issues are directed to higher authorities if unresolved.

Database Storage: Reports are stored for tracking and analysis.

Community Involvement: Encourages citizens to actively participate in pollution control.


This project aims to create a cleaner and healthier environment by leveraging technology to connect citizens with the authorities responsible for maintaining environmental standards.]

### The Problem statement
[Problem Statement: Pollution Tracker System

Environmental pollution is a growing concern that affects public health, ecosystems, and overall quality of life. Many pollution issues go unreported or are ignored due to a lack of an efficient reporting mechanism. Citizens often struggle to communicate local environmental problems to the appropriate authorities, leading to delayed or no action being taken.

The lack of accountability and follow-up further exacerbates the issue, as local authorities may not respond to complaints, leaving pollution problems unresolved. This calls for a structured and automated system that enables citizens to report pollution incidents and ensures that authorities take timely action.]

### The Solution
[The Pollution Tracker System is a web-based platform designed to empower citizens to report pollution issues in their locality. The system collects reports from users and automatically sends them via email to the relevant local authorities. If no action is taken within a predetermined timeframe, the system escalates the issue to higher authorities to ensure accountability and resolution.

This solution enhances environmental governance, encourages public participation in pollution control, and ensures that reported issues receive the necessary attention from responsible agencies.]
